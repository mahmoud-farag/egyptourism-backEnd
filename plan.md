## plan of action

- separate between the client and the server --

- modify the package.json scripts(for the backend , and frontend)--

- comment the production section code in the app.js (backend) --

- see how to link between the the backend and the new frontend(Naiem app) locally
  in two different folders  
  (the only way to test that is by using the postman, you will test the signUp, signIn, all the routes of the frontend using the postman locally ) --
  (in the production phase we will use the axios npm third-party lib to link between (to send reqs to the backend )the backend(deployed on heroku) and the frontend(deployed on the netlify) )

- modify the database schema locally and live based on the the new signUP, signIn new front
